	<description>Megafauna is one of the greatest animal mod in Rimworld, but it suffers his age now compared to other newest mods, it can feel weird to have low-res animals next to fancy ones on your map. This is just a basic AI Upscale, all animals are now 512*512px, some items like the trophies were upscaled to 128px. The rest (corpses textures, pack textures) is untouched to save memory. Every textures has been compressed from ~150ko to ~50ko to save your RAM usage.</description>
