# Megafauna AI Upscaled Textures
 Megafauna is one of the greatest animal mod in Rimworld, but it suffers his age now compared to other newest mods, it can feel weird to have low-res animals next to fancy ones on your map. This is just a basic AI Upscale, all animals are now 512*512px, some items like the trophies were upscaled to 128px. The rest (corpses textures, pack textures) is untouched to save memory. Every textures has been compressed from ~150ko to ~50ko to save your RAM usage.
