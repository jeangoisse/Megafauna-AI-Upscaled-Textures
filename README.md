# Megafauna AI Upscaled Textures
 Megafauna is one of the greatest animal mod in Rimworld, but it suffers his age now compared to other newest mods, it can feel weird to have low-res animals next to fancy ones on your map. This is just a basic AI Upscale, all animals are now 512x512px, some items like the trophies were upscaled to 128px. The rest (corpses textures, pack textures) is untouched to save memory. Every textures has been compressed from ~150ko to ~50ko to save your RAM usage.

 
 Next update will include Variety Coat mod as well.

 All rights are due to the authors of the original mod.
